As a user
    I should be able to view the alert page
    I should be able to report for an alert

    I should be able to view the history of each parameter values in a graph for a water station

From system
    when a water station reading is created,
    create an alert if the reading exceeds the given threshold



Backlogs:
1. Create a page to view all the alerts (UI)
    fetches from the backed
    
    APIContract:
        GET /alerts
        Return 200 [ { alert_type, message, location, station_id ... }]

2. Show a create report button for an alert if it is not already created
    on click it should show the report creation page (internally it should have the alert id)

    Update APIContract:
        POST /report
        - add alert_id field in the payload, and set report_id in that alert record

3. while fetching the station readings data, check if the parameter exceeds the given threshold
    create an alert record if it exceeds.

4. Given for a water stations the readings of each parameter is fetched every hour (day)
    take water station 1
    it has many station readins with parameter and a value

    Show recorded time in the x-axis and the value in the y-axis.
    Show a line of threshold

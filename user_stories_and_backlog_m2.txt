Backlogs:
1. create /stations route
    APIContract:
        GET /stations
        Return [ { name, la, ln,... }]
    
2. create a map UI in the dashboard and point the station locations in the map
    - use google maps API to show the maps view
    - get the stations data from the backend
    - set the pointers in the map based on station data

3. show a button on the navbar with name "Report"
    On clicking, show  a form to take report data
    fields:
        upload_photo
        location
        description
        water_source
        station_name

    APIContract
        POST /report { ... }
        Return 200
        Return 400

    fetches from the backed
    
    APIContract:
        GET /reports
        Return 200 [ { name, station_id, photo_url,... }]

5. When a report is viewed by authority, 
        and the report is in pending then
        show two buttons to mark (verified, rejected)
    when the button is clicked, call the API and update the report

    APIContract
        POST /report/action { verified: true, rejected: ... }
        * changes the status of the report
        Returns 200
